A “NEW BOOK” button brings up a form allowing users to input the details for a new book: author, title, number of pages, whether it’s been read etc. A button on each book’s display to remove the book from the library. A button on each book’s display to change its read status.

NOTE: Was not required to add any type of storage at this point in the course
